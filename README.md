# spring-applet

This repo contains two small `Python` scripts which illustrate (by visual animation) the concept of:
- (1) Mechanical resonance in the context of spring forced oscillations
- (2) Normal modes of a 3-spring mechanical system
- (3) Linearized inverted pendulum with square wave driving term
